# Attendance System

This is a simple attendance system coded in Java and H2 database. It is meant to keep track of attendance and the amount of time someone has spent logged in or checked in. For example, this could be used in a restaurant where employees check in and check out on a shared computer. Each user gets an account and the time is tracked for each account.

## Usage

As of this time, only Windows PCs are supported. Copy Attendance.exe and the out folder onto a selected location in your Windows PC. Alternatively, download the AttendanceSystem.zip file and extract to your preferred location. Make sure you have a Java Runtime Environment installed. Double-click on the AttendanceSystem.exe to run the program. The first user you create will be an admin. Then, the other users will be regular ones.
