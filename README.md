# Attendance System

This is a simple attendance system coded in Java and H2 database. It is meant to keep track of attendance and the amount of time someone has spent logged in or checked in. For example, this could be used in a restaurant where employees check in and check out on a shared computer. Each user gets an account and the time is tracked for each account.
